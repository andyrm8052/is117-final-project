                             <h4 class="card-title text-grey">Amazon 1994</h4>
                            <p>Amazon in its earlier years was focusing on books. Back in those years
                                technologies were not that advance or were not that reliable like today.
                                Amazon wasn't that popular and we can see why. They did revolutionized
                                the E-Commercial industry.
                                <br>
                                <br>This is what Amazon looked like in the 90s.</p>
                            <div class="amazon">
                                <img src="img/amazon1.png">
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>A very bland design. Similarly to any other websites from the 90s. People
                                are more creative now that we have better technologies. Their website was
                                also simple compared to now. You only had a few links to navigate. Unlike
                                today, there are a lot of links and a lot you can do in Amazon.</p>
                            <br>
                             <h4 class="card-title text-grey">Amazon 2020</h4>
                            <p>Today, Amazon is considered the best online retail store. Amazon did revolutionized
                                the E-Commercial industry. Amazon sells everything you can possibly think
                                of. That's the main reason why it is so successful and why many companies
                                are going online as well. Amazon has kept their book market active and
                                in fact they have one of the best. You can buy, sell or rent any book you
                                like.
                                <br>
                                <br>This is what the homepage looks like now.</p>
                            <div class="amazon2">
                                <img src="img/amazon2.png">
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            <p>Compared to the 90s. The website has taken a static design. Simple and
                                appealing. They are using the white color like many other websites do today.
                                White makes things easier to read. They also have everything you need in
                                just a few tabs. Similarly to before, Amazon used spotlight to promote
                                any news or product. However, since we have videos to use as promotion,
                                websites tend to post them in their homepage to get their attention and
                                attract customers easier.</p>
