                            <p>In the 90,s E-Commercial websites were not that popular. The internet was not
                                that big back then. Not many people had a computer nor internet. Today
                                this is not a problem and it is a reason why E-Commercial websites are
                                a huge part of the internet in this time.
                                <br>
                                <br>Amazon was one of the first website to start selling online. They used
                                to sell books online. It was not until the 2000s that Amazon began to get
                                bigger. To start selling not just books, but more products that we could
                                use in the everyday life. A big reason why E-Commercial is so successful
                                is due to technology. It has become so important today that these companies
                                relied on them. It is where they mostly earn money and why people visit
                                their websites.
                                <br>
                                <br>eBay is the other E-Commercial website that competes with Amazon. There
                                are many more, but I am focusing on the most popular. In this case, eBay
                                and Amazon were founded almost in the same time. However, eBay was more
                                than just a selling type website. People could and still can auction products.
                                Unlike Amazon, one of the bigger reason why eBay has become better
                                at it. In the other hand, Amazon has become better for companies to sell
                                their products while eBay is better for people to sell anything they want.
                                <br>
                                <br>This is where the competition ends. One is better for auctions while the
                                other for selling products. Amazon became better at selling products specially
                                technology. eBay became better for auctions and for selling used products.
                                Today since more people are using the internet, E-Commercial websites are
                                becoming more important. People tend to buy something from the internet
                                than going out to their local store. This is one reasons why local
                                stores are closing and moving to the online world.
                                <br>
                                <br>Back then these website were lacking on many features. Since technology
                                has improve, these websites did as well. We can find and we can interact
                                with more things then what we could before.</p>
