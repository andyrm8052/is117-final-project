                             <h4 class="card-title text-grey">MySpace 2003</h4>
                            <p>Myspace launched before Facebook. Some could say that Facebook took
                                the idea from Myspace. However, the thing with these two websites is that
                                one did it better than the other. First, Myspace was the first social
                                media website I used before Facebook. I remember using it before I began
                                high school. Myspace was so interesting that all of my friends only wanted
                                to visit each other's profile to see our template creations. Of course,
                                same as Facebook we could message each other.
                                <br>
                                <br>The other cool thing Myspace had that Facebook was lacking when
                                released was that we could customize our profile home page and add
                                music. Many people always wanted to visit someone else's profile page
                                to see hear their favorite song.
                                <br>
                                <br>This below is how Myspace used to look like when it was first launched.</p>
                            <div
                            class="myspace">
                                <img src="img/myspace1.png">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>Same as Facebook the design of the page was simple. Although, in Myspace
                            you had many different options to navigate. Such as blog, groups and
                            more.</p>
                        <br>
                         <h4 class="card-title text-grey">MySpace 2020</h4>
                        <p>Today, Myspace has changed a lot compared to Facebook. It did improved
                            but somehow it is not being use like before. Although, they
                            have reinvented the website. It is mostly based on music compared to back
                            then.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </p>
                        <div class="myspace2">
                            <img src="img/myspace2.png">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>Their new homepage design looks more appealing than before. They still
                            kept the idea of multiple options to navigate. However, they changed the
                            way their homepage looks a lot. Now it is mostly pictures and promotions.
                            As you scroll, you can see artist and videos suggestions. Myspace has become
                            more of a news industry than what it used to be.</p>
