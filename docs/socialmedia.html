                            <p>There are plenty of Social Medias websites that people use today. Many
                                of them are still active, however, many of them have lost popularity and
                                there are a few reasons why.
                                <br>
                                <br>For the first part of Social Medias I will write about two of the most
                                used websites back before the 2010s. Although, there were more popular
                                websites back then, but I will only focus on a couple and the ones that
                                introduced me to Social Media. One of the first social media websites that
                                I ever used was MySpace back in the mid to late 2000s. The second website
                                that pretty much revolutionized the social media industry was Facebook.
                                Not many people know about MySpace, but many do know about Facebook.
                                <br>
                                <br>Back in the 90s social media wasn't a thing. The way people communicated
                                was thru mail or phone calls. Today we can do that with a single step.
                                We can communicate with anyone in the word in a matter of seconds. This
                                is the reason why social media became that important and relevant today.
                                There are so many social media websites but the only ones that have been
                                this successful back in those years were the ones I described. Of course
                                Facebook is still relevant today and one of the most used websites. However,
                                I'm writing about these specific years where social media began to take
                                shape.
                                <br>
                                <br>There are more reasons why social media became popular, but I will give
                                one last reason why they have. The idea of posting a picture of yourself
                                or anyone and allowing someone else far away to see it was one of the coolest
                                experience I had when I began to use social medias. I could instantly see
                                one of my friends or family members in a matter of seconds and also write
                                to them in those same post. These are a few of the reasons whe social media
                                has become very important.</p>
                            <br>
                             <h3 class="card-title text-grey">Part 2</h3>
                            <p>In this second part I will write about the newest types of social medias.
                                That being said, they all are considered social medias, however, there
                                are some differences between these type of social medias websites compared
                                to the earlier ones. These social medias are mostly used for a couple of
                                reason. One of them is for getting fast news or any sort of information
                                from a follower or someone you follow. The other reason is for commercial
                                use. Well, a lot of people use them for uploading pictures, but almost
                                everything is becoming advertisements in te social media industry.
                                <br>
                                <br>One of these social media website is Twitter. One of the most used social
                                medias website today. Twitter compared to the early social medias websites
                                is mostly based on a fast way of getting information instead of live chatting
                                with someone far away, such as Facebook. The other social media website
                                is Instagram. Well, Instagram is mostly popular on mobiles and was meant
                                to be for them. However, people can still use it via a computer like any
                                other websites.
                                <br>
                                <br>Instagram is where advertisement takes shape. Instagram can be used for
                                uploading pictures and messaging someone like any other social media website,
                                but today people are using it mostly based on advertisements. You could
                                have a gaming account or a beauty or an art account, you can earn money
                                just by simply promoting their products.
                                <br>
                                <br>Social media has come a long way and it seems that it will keep growing
                                and become more important each day.</p>
