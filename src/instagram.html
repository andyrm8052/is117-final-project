                        Instagram was another similar social media website to Twitter. However, Instagram
                        could not be used from a computer. You had to download an app and use it on your mobile.
                        Similarly to Twitter when it first was launched, Instagram was another messaging platform. Although,
                        it was more of a picture sharing site. <br><br>
                        This is what the website looked like before.

                    <div class="instagram">
                    <img src="img/instagram1.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><p> A bit different design template to the other social media websites. They simply had a download
                    button that directed you to a mobile app store. However, they kept a simple design to their homepage.
                </p>

                    <h4 class="card-title text-grey">Instagram 2020</h4>
                    <p>
                        Compared to the other social media platforms, Instagram is new. They have kept their features
                        very similar to when it was first introduced. Same goes for the website design. Now you can
                        use Instagram from a computer. The reason is because websites are becoming more important each
                        day since we have everything we need in one single place.

                        <br><br> This is what it looks like now.
                    </p>
                    <div class="instagram2">
                        <img src="img/instagram2.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><p> The website look almost the same compared to the old one. The only thing they have changed
                    is the color. White is becoming a more reliable color for websites today. It makes things easier to
                    see. It makes other design pop up more. <br><br>
                    Instagram in the other hand has kept their way of uploading pictures and commenting the same.
                    unlike Twitter which has become more for sharing stories. Instagram is becoming more of an advertisement
                    site today. If you use the application you will be flooded with people promoting stuff for other
                    websites. Even ads are appearing in your timeline. Things are changing a lot in the social media
                    industry. The main reason is commercial and advertisements.
