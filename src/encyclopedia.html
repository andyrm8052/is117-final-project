                        Encyclopedia tends to be like a dictionary. Similar to Google and Yahoo!, Wikipedia is used
                        to find information. People specially teachers tend to say not to use Wikipedia because information
                        are not that reliable. The reason is because you can go and edit any information yourself.
                        However, the Encyclopedia industry in the internet is very popular and great for finding
                        any sort of information and really fast. Unlike any other Search Engine website where you have
                        to specifically search and click on the link you find most appealing. In an Encyclopedia
                        website you can find the information directly thru there. <br><br>
                        Wikipedia is well known and used a lot. Mostly I used it to find any sort of information
                        regarding definitions or information about places or people. Back in the 90s we
                        could not do that. For us to find any sort of information we must read the newspaper or watch
                        the news. Now we have it right in the tips of our fingers.
