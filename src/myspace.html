                        Myspace was launched before Facebook. Some could say that Facebook took the idea from Myspace.
                        However, the thing with these two websites is that one did it better then the other.
                        First of all, Myspace  was the first social media website I used before Facebook. I remember
                        using it before I began high school. Myspace was so interesting that all of my friends
                        only wanted to visit each others profile to see our template creations. Of course,
                        same as Facebook we could message each other. <br><br> The other cool thing Myspace had that
                        Facebook was lacking then it was first released was that we could customize our profile home
                        page and add music. A lot of people always wanted to visit someone else's profile page
                        to see hear their favorite song.
                        <br><br> This below is how Myspace used to look like when it was first launched.

                    <img src="img/myspace1.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><p>Same as Facebook the design of the page was simple. Although, in Myspace you had
                    a lot of different options to navigate. Such as blog, groups and more.

                    <p>
                    Today, Myspace has changed a lot compared to Facebook. It did improved but somehow it is not
                        being used that much like it used to. Although, they have reinvented the website. It is mostly based on
                        music compared to back then. <br><br>

                    <div class="myspace2">
                        <img src="img/myspace2.png">
                    </div>
                    <br><p> Their new homepage design looks more appealing then before. They still kept the idea of
                    multiple options to navigate. However, they changed the way their homepage looks a lot. Now it is
                    mostly pictures and promotions. As you scroll you can see artist and videos suggestions. Myspace
                    has become more of a news industry than what it used to be.
