                        Facebook was launched in 2004. Back then many people didn't have internet or computers.
                        Social media wasn't that big compared to today. That being said, Facebook wasn't popular or
                        known.<br><br>
                        This is what Facebook used to look back when it first was launched.

                    <div class="facebook">

                    </div>
                    <br><p>Back then Facebook was simpler in a way where there wasn't a lot to do. You simply register
                    for a new account. Login then message someone if you wanted or upload a picture. There wasn't a lot
                    you could do compared to now. Facebook in my opinion revolutionized the industry and many other
                    companies followed its path.</p>

                    <p>
                    Today, Facebook can be used for more than just messaging and uploading pictures.<br><br>
                        This is what Facebook looks like now.

                    </div>
                    <br><p> You can see that not only the way we use this website have changed, but the style too.
                    Things are becoming more about styles, colors, templates, etc. Facebook when it was first launched
                    had more details in their pictures. Today Facebook and other websites have simple images. The reason
                    is because things tend to change and they are prefer that way. Simpler design that looks more static.
                    More details means more work and it sometimes makes it harder to look at.
                    <br><br> Facebook today is not just about communication. Now we can create groups specifically for
                    anything that we enjoy. If you are a fan of sports you can join/follow a group that you could
                    read or watch news about. There is another reason why social media has changed a lot specially Facebook.
                    Games is the reason and one that since to keep becoming bigger. Back then Facebook didn't have games.
                    Now you can play games thru Facebook or your mobile phone using its account. You can play against
                    others and have a blast. No matter what changes are coming they tend to make it more enjoyable.
