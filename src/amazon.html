                        Amazon in its earlier years was focusing on books. Back in those years technologies
                        were not that advance or were not that reliable like today. Amazon wasn't that popular
                        and we can see why. They did revolutionized the E-Commercial industry. <br><br>
                        This is what Amazon looked like in the 90s.

                    <br><p> A very bland design. Similarly to any other websites from the 90s. People are more
                    creative now that we have better technologies. Their website was also simple compared to now. You
                    only had a few links to navigate. Unlike today, there are a lot of links and a lot you can do in
                    Amazon.

                       Today, Amazon is considered the best online retail store. Amazon did revolutionized the E-Commercial
                        industry. Amazon sells everything you can possibly think of. That's the main reason why it is so
                        successful and why many companies are going online as well. Amazon has kept their book market active
                        and in fact they have one of the best. You can buy, sell or rent any book you like.

                        <br><br> This is what the homepage looks like now.

                    </div>
                    <br><p> Compared to the 90s. The website has taken a static design. Simple and appealing. They are
                    using the white color like many other websites do today. White makes things easier to read. They also
                    have everything you need in just a few tabs. Similarly to before, Amazon used spotlight to promote
                    any news or product. However, since we have videos to use as promotion, websites tend to post
                    them in their homepage to get their attention and attract customers easier.
