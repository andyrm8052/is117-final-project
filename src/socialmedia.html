                    <p>
                        There are plenty of Social Medias websites that people use today. Many of them are still active,
                        however, many of them have lost popularity and there are a few reasons why. <br><br>

                        For the first part of Social Medias I will write about two of the most used websites back before
                        the 2010s. Although, there were more popular websites back then, but I will only focus on a couple
                        and the ones that introduced me to Social Media. One of the first social media websites that I
                        ever used was MySpace back in the mid to late 2000s. The second website that pretty much
                        revolutionized the social media industry was Facebook. Not many people know about MySpace, but
                        many do know about Facebook. <br><br>
                        Back in the 90s social media wasn't a thing. The way people communicated was thru mail or phone calls.
                        Today we can do that with a single step. We can communicate with anyone in the word in a matter
                        of seconds. This is the reason why social media became that important and relevant today. There
                        are so many social media websites but the only ones that have been this successful back in
                        those years were the ones I described. Of course Facebook is still relevant today and one
                        of the most used websites. However, I'm writing about these specific years where social media
                        began to take shape. <br><br>
                        There are more reasons why social media became popular, but I will give one last reason why they
                        have. The idea of posting a picture of yourself or anyone and allowing someone else far away
                        to see it was one of the coolest experience I had when I began to use social medias. I could
                        instantly see one of my friends or family members in a matter of seconds and also write to them
                        in those same post. These are a few of the reasons whe social media has become very important.

                    <p>
                        In this second part I will write about the newest types of social medias. That being said, they
                        all are considered social medias, however, there are some differences between these type of
                        social medias websites compared to the earlier ones. These social medias are mostly used for
                        a couple of reason. One of them is for getting fast news or any sort of information from a follower
                        or someone you follow. The other reason is for commercial use. Well, a lot of people use them for
                        uploading pictures, but almost everything is becoming advertisements in te social media industry.
                        <br><br> One of these social media website is Twitter. One of the most used social medias website
                        today. Twitter compared to the early social medias websites is mostly based on a fast way of
                        getting information instead of live chatting with someone far away, such as Facebook. The other
                        social media website is Instagram. Well, Instagram is mostly popular on mobiles and was meant to
                        be for them. However, people can still use it via a computer like any other websites. <br><br>
                        Instagram is where advertisement takes shape. Instagram can be used for uploading pictures
                        and messaging someone like any other social media website, but today people are using it mostly
                        based on advertisements. You could have a gaming account or a beauty or an art account, you can
                        earn money just by simply promoting their products.<br><br> Social media has come a long way
                        and it seems that it will keep growing and become more important each day.
