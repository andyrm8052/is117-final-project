                        Similar to Amazon eBay was launched in the 90s. It not only sold books
                        unlike Amazon. It also sold technology and much more. eBay was become a better
                        website to buy stuff compared to Amazon. The problem is that Amazon took over eBay.

                        This is what eBay looked like in the 90s.

                      eBay today has kept almost the same style in their website and the same function. They are still
                        selling the products, but it has expanded. They are still doing auction and in fact it is one
                        of the best one from the E-Commercial industries.

                    </div>
                    <br><p>Now eBay looks different than what it looks like before. Everything changes, so no one
                    can expect something to stay the same way. Their website is one of the things that changed. Similar
                    to Amazon, eBay is using the photo/videos ads to attract the customers and click on the product.
                    They have kept the same colors but everything is more organized which is something very important today
                    in order to make someone not leave your website.
