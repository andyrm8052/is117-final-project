                        Search Engines are similar to a dictionary. Although, in a different way they tend to be
                        better for finding information. We can find any sort of news, videos, pictures, etc. from this
                        Search Engines in a matter of seconds. The internet has changed a lot and it keeps changing by
                        making it easier for us to do anything. <br><br>
                        Back in the 90s we could search for things in the internet. However, it was not fast nor
                        reliable in some ways. Today we can do that faster and find so much information that it could
                        take us days or months to reach the end. Today we have two big reliable Search Engines
                        that people use in a daily basis. One of them is Google, one or perhaps the most used Search
                        Engine in the world. Billions of people have visited the site since it debuted. Billions or more
                        people have searched in the websites for any sort of information. <br><br> The other one is
                        Yahoo. It might not be as popular as it was a few years ago, but Yahoo! was launched before
                        Google. The problem is that the newer thing tends to be better and almost always surpasses it.
                        Similarly to Google, Yahoo! was used to search for information. As time passes, these two
                    websites have made life easier for anyone. You can learn and find any sort of information
                    by just typing whatever you want in a matter of seconds.
