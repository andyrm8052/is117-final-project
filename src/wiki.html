                        Wikipedia in the early 2000s was mostly used for finding definitions. It wasn't always like that.
                        Although, people only visited the sites to find any quick information about something.
                        Similar to the Search Engines, there was not a lot you could search back then.

                    <br><p> Wikipedia has always been used. Although, since there are so many website specially
                    Search Engine website that you can search anything, Wikipedia has lost many visitors. I used
                    to use it back when I was in high school. Now we can do anything thru Google. Although, Wikipedia
                    for me is still great for definitions and information about places and people. <br><br> Their
                    website homepage looks similar to any other website back in the 90s or early 2000s. Having a lot
                    of links centered in the homepage was popular. Although, now it tends to be a bit too much.

                      Encyclopedias today are on another level like many other websites and industries. More things
                        start to come to the internet which means more information is gathered and used. We used to go
                        to the libraries to read a book. Now we can go to an online Encyclopedia like Wikipedia
                        to read a short summary of anything and you immediately will know about it without buying and
                        just by simply reading for a couple of minutes.

                    <br><p>Their website is better looking. Similar to that of Google. It is simple with a limited
                    amount of links. The only things we do is type anything we want to know about and in a matter of
                    seconds we can read about it without having to rent, buy or read a whole book.
