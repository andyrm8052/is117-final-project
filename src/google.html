                        Similar to YouTube, Google was not well known so not many people used the website. Google
                        resemble a newspaper and a dictionary at the same time. Although, back when it was first
                        introduced there wasn't many things you could search for.

                    </div>
                    <br><p> Google website was basic and at the same time it was easy to use. Although, I previously
                    stated that some website look weird because of stretched images or misplaced content. In this case
                    Google had some large boxes that made it look weird.

                    <p>
                      Today, Google is similar to back then, but at the same time better. The static page, just pure
                        white background with a few clickable links makes it so easy to navigate and so easy to read.
                        You don't have to make a website with a lot of design to make it look good. Simpler means less
                        work and better looking.

                    <br><p> Now we mostly based anything we need off of Google. It is a scary thing if you thing about it.
                    These websites used to be simple for short information needed. Now we take them too much into
                    consideration when we need anything. We simply search it and that's it. Google simply made anything
                    easier. It is not a bad thing because you can learn anything using Google. That's why it is so
                    important and popular. Anything is almost possible in Google with just a simple click.
