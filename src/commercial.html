                    <p>
                        In the 90s E-Commercial websites were not that popular. The internet wasn't that bing back then.
                        Not many people had a computer nor internet. Today this is not a problem and it is a reason
                        why E-Commercial websites are a huge part of the internet in this time. <br><br>
                        Amazon was one of the first website to start selling online. They used to sell books online.
                        It wasn't until the 2000s that Amazon began to get bigger. To start selling not just books, but
                        more products that we could use in the everyday life. A big reason why E-Commercial is so
                        successful is because of technology. It has become so important today that these companies
                        relied on them. It is where they mostly earn money and why people visit their websites.
                        <br><br> eBay is the other E-Commercial website that competes with Amazon. There are many
                        more, but I'm focusing on the most popular. In this case eBay and Amazon were founded
                        almost in the same time. However, eBay was more than just a selling type website. People
                        could and still can auction products. Unlike Amazon, this is one of the bigger reason
                        why eBay has become better at it. In the other hand, Amazon has become better for companies
                        to sell their products while eBay is better for people to sell anything they want.<br><br>
                        This is where the competition ends. One is better for auctions while the other for selling products.
                        Amazon became better at selling products specially technology. eBay became better for auctions
                        and for selling used products. Today since more people are using the internet, E-Commercial
                        websites are becoming more important. People tend to buy something from the internet than
                        going out to their local store. This is one of the reasons why local stores are closing
                        and moving to the online world. <br><br> Back then these website were lacking on a lot of
                        features. Since technology has improve, these websites did as well. We can find and we can
                        interact with more things then what we could before.
