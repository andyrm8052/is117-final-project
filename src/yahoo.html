                    <p>
                        Similar to Google, was used and is still being used for searching anything. Although, back
                        there wasn't a lot you could search for. The reason is because there weren't many website.
                        There were not many people posting any information. Yahoo! was before Google. Anything you
                        search today we used to do that on Yahoo!. <br><br> This is what Yahoo! looked like.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <br><p> Again, same like the other websites. A lot of links that made it harder to read
                    because you had everything in the same place It might not look that bad since you had everything
                    in one place you could find stuff easier. However, back in the 90s, websites weren't meant
                    to look great.

                    <p>
                     Now Yahoo is well known and competes with Google. Although, Google has taken over the
                        Search Engines platforms. Although, Yahoo has kept their same design aspect by
                        leaving their categories of options in their homepage.

                    </div>
                    <br><p> A website that you can find anything and that looks appealing. Compared to Google,
                    Yahoo! kept the newspaper style design. They introduced images and videos in their homepage
                    to get more attention from people visiting. Google kept it simple. However, Yahoo! tends to be
                    better in some other aspects compared to Google and how it used to be. They have created more
                    than just a Search Engine. People can now interact and entertain themselves thru a fantasy sports
                    platform. They can also read and watch videos directly thru Yahoo!. Unlike Google which takes you
                    to another website.
